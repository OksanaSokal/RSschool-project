Hi, I’m Oksana and I’m excited to have the opportunity to introduce myself to you.
Currently, I'm a student in Rolling Scopes School, and I’ve been diving into the world of frontend development.
It was quite the journey for me because just last year I decided to change my career path and pursue the frontend development.
What I find captivating about development is incredible logic behind it all. Every line of code feels like a puzzle waiting to be solved, and I can't get enough of it.
During my studying in Rolling Scopes School I got knowledge about HTML, CSS, Javascript and also I even touched a little bit NODE.js It was so interesting.
During our course we made some websites. It was library site. It was coffee shop sites. Also made some interesting game.
One of my favorite task was coffee shop site. It was interesting for me because it was the first time when I make site without using HTML and I just make it throw Javascript.
Also, I really liked our last task game. It was nanograms game. It was interesting because here we used knowledge about algorithm matrix in our real work.
One thing that I’m really looking forward to is the chance to work in real project. You know the kind of way you’re not just practicing and experimenting but when you’re part of team building something that people will actually use.
I can’t wait to deep into process of programming. I can’t wait to dive into the real project to see how everything comes together from start to finish.
It is going to be an exciting adventure, and I am ready to roll up my sleeves and get started.
Thank you very much for listening myself introduction. I hope it was interesting to know a little bit about me bye
